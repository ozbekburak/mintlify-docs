# Authentication and Access Control

Binalyze Fleet AI implements enterprise-grade authentication and access control mechanisms to ensure secure access to cybersecurity AI capabilities. This comprehensive guide covers authentication methods, session management, security controls, and best practices for protecting your cybersecurity operations.

## Authentication Methods

### **JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication**
Primary authentication method for secure API access:

**JWT Token Structure**:
```json
{
  "header": {
    "alg": "RS256",
    "typ": "JWT",
    "kid": "fleet-ai-key-1"
  },
  "payload": {
    "sub": "user@company.com",
    "iss": "fleet.binalyze.com",
    "aud": "fleet-ai-api",
    "exp": 1735689600,
    "iat": 1735603200,
    "roles": ["security-analyst", "incident-responder"],
    "permissions": ["yara:generate", "sigma:create", "osquery:execute"],
    "organization": "company-org-id",
    "session_id": "sess_abc123def456"

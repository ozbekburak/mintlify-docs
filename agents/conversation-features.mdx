- **Coordinated Analysis**: Multiple agents working with common context

## Advanced Message Management

### **Message Editing Workflow**
Enhance your questions for better results:

1. **Initial Query**: Start with your cybersecurity question or investigation need
2. **Review Response**: Analyze the initial response and identify areas for improvement
3. **Edit Message**: Modify your original question to add context, refine scope, or change focus
4. **Enhanced Response**: Receive improved response based on refined query
5. **Iterate**: Continue refining until you achieve optimal results

**Example Editing Sequence**:
```
Original: "Create a YARA rule for malware detection"

Edited: "Create a YARA rule to detect Emotet banking trojan variants 
focusing on PE structure characteristics and C2 communication patterns"

Result: More specific, targeted rule generation with detailed analysis
```

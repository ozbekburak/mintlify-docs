# Team Routing System

The Team Routing System in Binalyze Fleet AI manages the intelligent selection, activation, and coordination of specialized agent teams based on investigation complexity, scope, and requirements. This sophisticated routing mechanism ensures that cybersecurity investigations receive the optimal combination of specialized expertise and coordinated workflows.

## Team Selection Logic

### **Routing Decision Framework**
The system analyzes multiple factors to determine optimal team activation:

**Investigation Complexity Assessment**:
- **Single-Domain vs. Multi-Domain**: Simple queries route to individual agents, complex investigations activate teams

- **Expertise Requirements**: Multiple specialized skills trigger team-based coordination
- **Resource Intensity**: High-complexity investigations benefit from team-based parallel processing

**Team Activation Triggers**:
- **Comprehensive Detection Requests**: Need for YARA + Sigma + OSQuery coordination
- **Multi-Phase Investigations**: Complex workflows requiring orchestrated agent sequences
- **Cross-Platform Analysis**: Investigations spanning multiple security domains simultaneously
- **Enterprise-Scale Deployments**: Large-scope implementations requiring coordinated execution

### **Available Team Configurations**

#### **Detection Team**
**Activation Criteria**:
- Requests for comprehensive threat detection across multiple vectors
- Need for coordinated rule generation (YARA + Sigma + OSQuery)
- APT campaign analysis requiring multi-layered detection
- Malware family detection with file, log, and endpoint coverage

**Team Composition**:
- **YARA Agent**: File-based malware detection and memory forensics
- **Sigma Agent**: Log-based behavioral detection and SIEM integration
- **OSQuery Agent**: Endpoint telemetry and system investigation
- **Detection Coordinator**: Workflow orchestration and result integration

#### **Blacklight Team**
**Activation Criteria**:
- Complex multi-domain investigations requiring central orchestration
- Need for sophisticated conversation state management

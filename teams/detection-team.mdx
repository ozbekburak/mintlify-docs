# Detection Team

The Detection Team represents a coordinated approach to cybersecurity threat detection, bringing together the specialized expertise of YARA, Sigma, and OSQuery agents to provide comprehensive detection coverage across files, logs, and endpoints. This team-based approach ensures that threats are detected at multiple layers of your security infrastructure.

## Team Composition

### **Specialized Agent Coordination**
The Detection Team consists of three specialized agents working in harmony:

- **YARA Agent**: File-based malware detection and memory forensics
- **Sigma Agent**: Log-based behavioral detection and SIEM integration  
- **OSQuery Agent**: Endpoint telemetry and system-level investigation
- **Team Coordinator**: Intelligent orchestration and workflow management

### **Unified Detection Strategy**
Each agent contributes unique capabilities while maintaining coordinated detection objectives:

- **Multi-Layer Coverage**: Detection across files, logs, and system state
- **Complementary Techniques**: Different detection methods that reinforce each other
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Complete threat coverage from multiple perspectives
- **Coordinated Response**: Synchronized detection rules for unified deployment

## How the Detection Team Works
